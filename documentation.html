	Princeton Maps is an interactive map of Princeton's campus -- 500 acres in central New Jersey.  Most importantly, 
it is searchable, allowing tourists, parents, freshmen, and other people to easily find any building on campus.  

	To use Princeton Maps, please first ensure that your browser has Javascript and Java enabled, and that you have
a microphone if you wish to use voice control with Princeton Maps.  Now visit: </pre><p><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~adamchin/maps/" title="Princeton Maps" target="_blank" style="color:#f40;">http://www.princeton.edu/~adamchin/maps/</a></p><pre>	You will see an orange-bordered map centred at Princeton's campus, as well as a search bar, buttons, and 
checkboxes at the top.  

	Let's move from left to right.  Below the Princeton Maps logo are 3 checkboxes labelled Photos, Wikipedia, and Youtube.
These allow you to add/remove geocoded panoramio pictures, wikipedia articles, and youtube videos on the map in whatever 
combination you'd like.  Be sure to check out the picture of a Princeton black squirrel (southwest of campus).

	Next comes the search bar.  Type any building name into the search bar, click the "Find" button, and the map will 
zoom in on the building and place a nice, red marker there.  Also, notise that typing just portions of building names 
triggers an autocomplete dropdown menu, potentially saving you some typing.  

	Finally, the fun part: voice control.  Please note that all audio will be sent to servers at the 
MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory for research purposes.  If you have taken too long going 
through the preceding stuff, the button on the right may have turned red with message "Error: Connection Failure".  
This just means you were inactive with it for too long and MIT's servers cut the connection.  Refresh the page, and 
it will turn green again with message "Hold to talk". 

	Click this green button, and say a building name clearly into your microphone.  When you release the green button,
the map will zoom in and place a marker on what should (hopefully!) be what you said.  It will also play a voice synthesis
of what it thinks you said, and then a recording of what you actually said.  Voice control exists for map 
operations as well.  Try clicking the green button and saying "zoom in", or "zoom out", as well as "pan up", 
"pan right", etc.  You can also get directions to Princeton by saying, "directions".     	 

	That's it for external controls!  You'll notise that on the Google Map itself are familiar controls for panning, 
zooming, and multiple map views (if you have the Google Earth plugin, you will have an extra tab for "earth" mode).

	Enjoy!

	Adam
